# Number Guess

Now that you've got a place to work on python projects and a loose understanding of things it's time to put concepts together and get your hands dirty working on actual projects. 

# project

Create a python application that picks a random number between 1-100, accepts user input of a number between 1-100 and tells the user if they have guessed the number correctly or not, this should repeat until the user has guessed the number correctly.

> bonus points for telling them hints like "very far away!" or "you almost got it" as examples.
